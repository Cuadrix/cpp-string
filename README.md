# cpp-string-class
A simple and fast C++ string class implementation.

1. [Introduction]
  This library features a template class which represents an easy and lightweight implementation of an std::basic_string-like class.
  It's formally supposed to show, how an advanced string class could work. Therefore, it shouldn't be seen as an replacement of std::string but as a fast and simple alternative to it. It covers most of the std::basic_string's features, including iterators.
